# Cycling Progress Tracker with Pixela
## Overview
Hello, I'm Mert, and today marks Day 37 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. In this project, I've created a Python script named `main.py` that helps you track your cycling progress using Pixela. You can record the distance you cycle each day and visualize your progress over time.

## Project Description
The script interacts with the Pixela API to create an account, define a graph for tracking cycling distances, add daily data points, update entries, and even delete entries. It provides a simple and effective way to monitor your cycling achievements.

How to Run
To use the Cycling Progress Tracker script, follow these steps:

1. Open the Python script: `main.py`
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Fill in your Pixela API key, username, and customize the graph settings.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to record your daily cycling distance.
4. Explore the script to update or delete entries as needed.
5. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
## Project Files
* main.py: The main Python script for interacting with the Pixela API and tracking cycling progress.

## Customization
You can customize the script by modifying the USERNAME, TOKEN, and GRAPH_ID variables in the main.py file. Additionally, feel free to explore other features offered by the Pixela API and adapt the script to your specific preferences.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
* requests: For making HTTP requests to interact with the Pixela API.
## Educational Insights
